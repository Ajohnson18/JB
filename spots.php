                        <p>Bay Head is just south of Point Beach. Bay Head can offer some of the best tubes on the Jersey Shore. Bay Head has short jetties that create amazing waves during a hurricane swell. Parking in the summer at Bay Head is terrible
                            so get ready to walk to the beach. Bay Head is a quiet and local town so the beach is not as crowded as in other places. Bay Head is definitely a local spot. Whenever the waves are good, at any time of the year. I'll definitely
                            be in Bay Head.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The Manasquan Inlet is one of the top surf spots on the east coast. Waves will bounce off the rocks and create a steep right wedge. Manasquan can usually provide lengthy rides. With a south-east swell Manasquan can handle up to 20ft faces, with 2 fast, bowl-shaped peaks. You can also occasionally get a nice left. Just like many other beaches in the summer, Manasquan can get very crowded. Many locals dominate the peak on a good day. The Inlet has a nice rip along the rocks which can create a nice and easy paddle out, even on bigger days. Therefore this place is a great place to start learning to surf. Whenever I want to get a good surf, I always head to Manasquan.

                        <p>Belmar is an extremely popular surf spot here on the Jersey Shore. The whole Belmar beach is capable of massive, hollow tubes. On a good south-east swell, hollow barrels are common. Many of these beaches close during a summer hurricane swell. If caught surfing a hurricane swell, police will not hesitate to make an arrest. Sixteenth Ave. right across from Eastern Lines is the surf beach in the summer. Sixteenth Ave. will usually have some fun rides in most conditions. If you do go in the summer though, be ready for a heavy crowd of people. To the north of Sixteenth Ave. is the Eighth Ave. jetty. Eigth Ave. can produce heavy barrels. Eight Ave. is mostly for locals, and they won't be afraid to let you know that. Finally, at the end of the beach is the Belmar pier. This can produce nice rides on a north swell. Also by that jetty is Summertime Surf School. This is one of the best surf schools on the coast of New Jersey. There is no better place to start learning to surf! Finally, as we get into the fall, Belmar host one of it's greatest events... the Belmar Pro! There are tons of places to surf in Belmar as long as you can handle big crowds.

                        <p>Mantoloking is the next beach down from Bay Head. Here you will find many beach breaks. These are highly dependent on the sandbar. That means waves wont be so good when high-tide hits. There are no jeties in mantoloking so the current is usually an issue. But if you know when the waves will be good and you find a secluded spot, you may score some sick waves.

                        <p>Spring lake is a long strip of beach right before Belmar. Spring lake is nice in the summer because it does not get as crowded as most. Also Spring Lake is good for beginners because of its easier waves. At the south end of Spring Lake, you'll find another series of jetties that can produce some great days. The actual South End Jetty is a bit longer than the rest, because the sandbar is a bit farther outside, so it's a good spot on bigger days. There's also a left just down the beach that can get good on a northeast swell. Spring Lake is a small and tight community with pretty welcoming surfers.
